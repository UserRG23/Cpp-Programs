The problem is an extension of the simplified Table problem #1. We recommend to start with the simple problem and then extend it. The extension is simple - the tables in this problem shall support nested tables, i.e. a table may be placed into a cell in some other (or even in the same) table. The nested table is to be aligned top-left in the cell.

The rest of the problem remains the same, the interface of the classes remain the same. See the enclosed archive for sample runs.

A working solution of this homework may be used for code review (your solution must pass the mandatory and optional tests with 100% result).
